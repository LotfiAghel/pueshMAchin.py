run script fast + assert
assert and event - systems interlock - not move until other is out of reach

emergency stop
prepare all 10 nodes
vision for 10 nodes

  manipulate pins directly for motor pulse
  better non blocking motor run with fence return and status update
  yet faster trajectory

full script running continuesly
reset encoder before and after retract to make sure encoder works
---------------------
better vision
intial encoder value using redis
multiprocess vision model runner
logging (rpi/server)
debug vision
vision: auto roi / zero index
handle microstep
make sure pin status on homing
double trajectory
