Architectural changes:
  return error if motor has not reached position
  better non blocking motor run with fence return and status update
  fullfill valve and encoder condition before move - systems interlock - not move until other is out of reach
emergency stop
run script fast
manipulate pins directly for motor pulse
yet faster trajectory
full script running continuesly
---------------------
better vision
intial encoder value using redis
multiprocess vision model runner
logging (rpi/server)
debug vision
vision: auto roi / zero index
handle microstep
make sure pin status on homing
double trajectory
