rail jack setup
  encoder error + soft limit stop
  systems interlock - not move until other is out of reach
  don't run motor if not homed (or if override - go_steps)
  fullfill valve and encoder condition before move
  better non blocking motor run with fence return and status update
yet faster trajectory
run script fast
intial encoder value using redis
emergency stop
better vision
---------------------
multiprocess vision model runner
logging (rpi/server)
debug vision
vision: auto roi / zero index
handle microstep
make sure pin status on homing
double trajectory
