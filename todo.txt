vision exception handling - detect if holder and dosing not exist
recover encoder failure / encoder failure, yet not properly do the job
proper robot homing (go up first)
add rail jack checks
read inputs
better gcodes for arcs
---------------------------------------
relocation in middle based on encoder location
assert and event - systems interlock - not move until other is out of reach
add stations 6-10 / robot 2
sensor for rail jack
